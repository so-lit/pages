# ⛰️ Mountain Ridges ⛰️

A little art project to inspired by the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Uses [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) to generate an SVG.

It features a slider which lets you select the hue of the mountains, it's blue
by default of course. Changing it will update the URL hash so you can share
your favorite color mountain ranges with out even need to remix the project!

The mountain ranges are generated by an implementation of the
[midpoint displacement algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm).

It also computes when sunrise & sunset are and how far through the day it is.
It uses that to render a sun and dim for night time.

It's hard coded for Washington, DC but if you want a different location, just
[remix](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/blueridge) the project and change the
`longitude` and `latitude` variables in `index.js`
